## Why create this gitHub page?
As part of the training I am currently undergoing at BeCode.org, it was an opportunity to set up the use of git, HTML, and CSS. It also provided a chance to interact with deployment.
<br/>
<br/>
## Issues encountered?
I encountered some issues that I was able to resolve in subsequent projects, primarily related to linking the 'dist' to a GitHub project. 
<br/>
<br/>
## What did I think of this project?
It's great to discover new features and give even more power to Vite.
<br/>
<br/>
## Will there be a future version?
Yes, certainly. I hope to use a framework to provide a better experience.
<br/>
<br/>
## How to install it? 
Navigate to the directory:
```sh
cd v-card
```

<br/>

Make sure you have Node.js version 18 LTS installed beforehand:
```sh
npm i
```
<br/>

And you can view the development version:
```sh
npm run dev
```
<br/>

Please note that the installation instructions assume Node.js version 18 LTS is already installed. If you need further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask!
